Figure 2.30 is an output instance derived from code in 2.29.

Each line with a special legend represents a case for walking through an array with given size. 
For example, the 256M line means the array for traversing is 256MB in total.

The x-axis represents the stride (interval) for array element access. 
For example, if a given array is 8K and stride is 1K, then 8 element might be accessed in turn: 
a[0], a[1000], a[2000], ..., a[7000].

The y-axis represents how long an element in array of given size is accessed in average. 
For example, you can simply consider the access time for the interval over 100 is 105ns in average.
Notice that from the problem tips and the figure we can deduce there are two caches. 

To ease the difficulty of this problem for you, let's try to solve 2.4.b together to help you understand such a figure.

The longest access time used in figure 2.30 is 105ns, 
which must be a cache miss, thus the time to fetch data from memory is 105ns.

As for 2.4.a, it's a little harder. However, the interval over 100ns gives enough clues for you. Hope you figure it out by yourselves.

To solve all these problems, you should fully consider how the cache works with memory, especially what would happen when a 
cache miss occurs.

Best regards!
