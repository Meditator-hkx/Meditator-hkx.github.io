## Key Ideas

1. Fine-grained persistent data managment is a significant problem and we develop easy-to-use (user-friendly and flexible) APIs for data allocation, recycling and managemnt.
2. We design our management mechanism with real hardware condition (but not an assumption), and especially we integrate our system with App-Direct Mode (of Intel Appache E).
3. We design a hash-based allocation mechanism and an optimized undo logging in EFlightPM to reduce metadata overhead thus make efficient persistence.
4. We are the first to conduct extensive experiments on a real NVM platform, and the results show that
